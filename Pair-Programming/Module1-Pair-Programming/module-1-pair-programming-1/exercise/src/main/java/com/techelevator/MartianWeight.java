In case you've ever pondered how much you weigh on Mars, here's the calculation:
 	Wm = We * 0.378
 	where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth
 
Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user  
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

$ MartianWeight 
 
Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185
 
 98 lbs. on Earth is 37 lbs. on Mars.
 235 lbs. on Earth is 88 lbs. on Mars.
 185 lbs. on Earth is 69 lbs. on Mars.
