# CSS Grid and Responsive Design

## Overview of session

In this session, you'll build the CSS grid for a restaurant website. The students' starting lecture code contains the HTML markup and two stylesheets: `style.css` for the styling rules and `grid.css` where you'll add the grid rules. You'll create the necessary styles to build a page that looks like this:

![Restaurant Page](./restaurant.png)

You'll also use media query rules to define a "mobile view":

![Restaurant Page - Mobile](./restaurant-mobile.png)
