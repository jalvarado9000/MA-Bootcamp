# CSS Flexbox

## Overview of session

In this lecture, you'll lay out each area of a restaurant website using CSS Flexbox. The students' starting lecture code contains the HTML markup and two stylesheets: `styles.css` for general styling and `flexbox.css` where you'll add the flexbox rules. All of the basic styling rules are provided. You'll add flexbox rules to the `flexbox.css` file to complete the design.

The lecture notes use a wireframe that resembles the image below. You're encouraged to teach from the wireframe and build the solution over time rather than displaying the final image to the students upfront.

The final product is responsive. It looks like this:
