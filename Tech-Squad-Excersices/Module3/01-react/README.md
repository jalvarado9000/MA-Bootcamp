1. As a verification of your environment, please confirm that you can create a new react project with create-react-app.
2. Solve the JavaScript exercises in exercises.js. The index.html is linked to it, so you can check the output of the exercises.
3. We have created a react.html with the template provided in the slides in the section Using React. We tweaked the template to have the JavaScript code in its own file. Follow the instructions in react.js
