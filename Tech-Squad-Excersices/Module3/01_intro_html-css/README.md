# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Overview of session

In this lecture, you'll build a website for a restaurant. The website contains two pages: the main home page which contains the restaurant menu, and a page with a form to submit a reservation.

## Expected results

### Hints

Take advantage of code generation in IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code.

Remember to use semantic HTML

Use this endpoint in the form's action attribute: https://example.com/api/reservation

The main page should link to the reservations page, and vice versa.
